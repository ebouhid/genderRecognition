# Gender Recognition Project

![Project Logo](logo.png)

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a gender recognition project. The goal of this project is to evaluate and develop machine learning models to accurately recognize gender based on images. Later on, I'll post the performance metrics of each model on the test set.

## Data

The data used in this project is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maciejgronczynski/biggest-genderface-recognition-dataset?select=faces)

## Model Results

Here are the results for the best performing models on the test set:

| Model Name                  | Accuracy |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| Generic classification net  | 0.860    |
| Reset101                    | 0.931    |
| Resnet34                    | 0.948    |


You can find more details about the models and their performance in the respective directories in this repository.

**Disclaimer:** The Inception model implementation is currently not working and is not included in the model results.
